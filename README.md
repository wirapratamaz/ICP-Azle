## Features

- **React.js Setup:** The boilerplate comes with a well-structured React.js setup, making it easy to manage your frontend infrastructure.
- **ICP Canister:** ICP Canister integration is included, offering a powerful way to manage data and interactions on the Internet Computer.

List identities:
`dfx identity list`

Switch to the minter identity:
`dfx identity use minter`

Transfer ICP:
`dfx ledger transfer <ADDRESS>  --memo 0 --icp 100 --fee 0`
where:
 - `--memo` is some correlation id that can be set to identify some particular transactions (we use that in the marketplace canister).
 - `--icp` is the transfer amount
 - `--fee` is the transaction fee. In this case it's 0 because we make this transfer as the minter idenity thus this transaction is of type MINT, not TRANSFER.
 - `<ADDRESS>` is the address of the recipient. To get the address from the principal, you can use the helper function from the marketplace canister - `getAddressFromPrincipal(principal: Principal)`, it can be called via the Candid UI.


### Internet identity canister

`dfx deploy internet_identity` - that is the canister that handles the authentication flow. Once it's deployed, the `js-agent` library will be talking to it to register identities. There is UI that acts as a wallet where you can select existing identities
or create a new one.

### Marketplace canister

`dfx deploy dfinity_js_backend` - deploys the marketplace canister where the business logic is implemented.
Basically, it implements functions like add, view, update, delete, and buy products + a set of helper functions.

Do not forget to run `dfx generate dfinity_js_backend` anytime you add/remove functions in the canister or when you change the signatures.
Otherwise, these changes won't be reflected in IDL's and won't work when called using the JS agent.

### Marketplace frontend canister
`dfx deploy dfinity_js_frontend` - deployes the frontend app for the `dfinity_js_backend` canister on IC.
